This is the readme file for my image processor script.
I'd like to have this script open an image file and create a gif by sequentially applying different effects.
I'd like this personal project to teach me how to use Git, image processing packages, video creation packages, and GUI creation packages.


Current order of operations:
    Take in a file
    Apply a given effect stack at set intervals
    Save all those images into a gif at a predetermined framerate
    Export automatically
